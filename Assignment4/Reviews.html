				<h2>Divergent</h2>
	        <p>Divergent is a three part book series about a young girl living in futurist Chicago, where society has been divided into 5 factions based on their personalities and what they value. A test is supposed to tell them whether they belong in Dauntless (the fearless), Erudite (the intelligent), Amity (the peaceful), Abnegation (the selfless), or Candor (the honest. When Beatris Prior goes to take the test, however, her results are inconclusive and tell her that she belongs to 3 factions; she is divergent. It is dangerous to be divergent in a society that hunts them for not fitting into a category, and so the series follows Tris as she attempts to belong into one faction despite being divergent.</p>

				<h2>Hunger Games</h2>
	        <p>The Hunger Games, written by Susane Collins, is a dystopian book about the future. The government of Panem (once North America) has punished its citizens for an attempted uprising by creating the Hunger Games, in which 24 teenagers between the ages of 12-18 are sent to fight to death in an arena created by the gamemakers. 16-year old Katniss Everdeen volunteers when her younger sister is chosen to fight in these games. The series is a warning about multiple issues in todayâ€™s society that must be addressed.</p>

				<h2>Harry Potter</h2>
	        <p>Harry Potter is a book written by JK Rowling about a young boy named Harry Potter who goes to a wizarding school named Hogwarts. Throughout the series he makes friends and takes them on adventures to defeat an evil wizard named Voldemort. There are 7 books in the series in total, each one representing a year at Hogwarts. My personal favourite is book 4: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. it introduces a lot of interesting characters and begins to set the scene for the main part of the story.</p>
